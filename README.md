# Pokemon - Gotta Catch 'em All!
The poject aim was to provide an educational game for children. I chose Pokemon as a topic that children are familiar with.
 It's fun & interactive. Provides memory development and helps children with learning. Aimed for children between ages of 4yrs - 10yrs.
 
# UX
 I bring together elements of HTML, CSS & Javascript and I combine them to develope an interactive touch screen application.
 
The object of the game is to match two cards that are the same.
To do this you simple touch or click on the card you would like to choose and the card will flip over to show the character on the card. Once this is complete you choose your second card.
If both card characters are a match the cards stay face up and you move on to your next card. If both cards are a mis-match then both cards will flip back to their original position and you try again.
You have to try complete the game within the time frame given of 100 seconds and with the least amount of flips. If you complete the game successfully 'VICTORY' will appear on the screen. If you do not complete the game 'GAME OVER' will appear on the screen.
If you would like to try the game again or maybe a different family member or friend all you have to do is touch/click the screen and the game will restart. Have fun with friends and family.

# Installation 
The web/app works on muliple OS. I've tested this on Window's & Apple iOS opperating systems. I recommend latest browser settings.

# Testing
As I was progressing through the developing stage I conducted a number of tests through 'Jasmine.js'. I performed a number of performance tests to confirm the site works as expected.
Luckily I had two young children to test the game to prove the game worked as intended.(To make sure the Pokemon characters matched until completed).
The feedback was excellent.

During testing I proved the matching sequence worked by inspecting my code live.

BUGS - Audio, I am still working on adding audio to the game. I have removed audio tracks until this issue is fixed.

# Deployment
I deployed the web/app through Github, using technologies AWS , GIT and moving it from development into production. For this I used a method of pre-production into production.

Before deployment I designed/coded using a local copy. Once I was happy all testing was confirmed I deployed it through AWS, GIT and into Github into production system.
